#  Biomass Indoor Air Pollution Health Impacts — Soweto, Nairobi County

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes the health effects of indoor air pollution from biomass fuel use in Soweto, Kahawa West, Nairobi County. The study involves assessing the relationship between indoor biomass fuel use and health outcomes such as respiratory diseases, skin conditions, and other illnesses reported by community members.

##  Objectives

- Examine the sociodemographic characteristics of biomass fuel users.
- Determine health effects associated with biomass fuel use.
- Investigate environmental and behavioral factors affecting health outcomes.

##  Tools & Technologies

- **R**: Data analysis and visualization  
- **R Packages**: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data entry and cleaning

##  What’s in This Repo

- `biomass_analysis.R`: R script for data cleaning, exploratory data visualization, chi-square testing, and logistic regression analysis.
- `biomass_soweto_data.csv`: Sample dataset ("C:\Users\ELITEBOOK\Documents\biomass_data_soweto.csv")
- `README.md`: This file with an overview of the project.

##  Example Visualizations

- Bar plot of reported disease frequencies
- Distribution of fuel use types
- Logistic regression output for identifying health risk factors
